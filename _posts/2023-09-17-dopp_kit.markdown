What is a Dopp Kit?\
According to the [Chicago Tribune](https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2003-09-02-0309020136-story.html): Jerome Harris, a Chicago-resident, dropped out of school during the Depression and began doing janitorial work at his uncle Charles Doppelt’s company to help his family. The Charles Doppelt Co. was designing a new leather case for toiletries and Harris, then 19-years-old, eventually became the designer for the case.\
\
It was named a Dopp kit, based off Charles’ last name. The Dopp kit was issued to GI’s during World War II and became so popular that Samsonite ended up buying the company in the 1970’s.\
\
The kits were a popular gift given to boys when they became men, so now, Dopp kits are used to describe toiletry bags used by men while toiletry bag is the term used by women (although, of course, a woman can use a Dopp kit and vice versa).

What should be in your Dopp Kit?

Yes, another travel and packing post.  Much like using packing cubes, I look at everything as a set kit that can contain smaller kits.  They all work together.  My Dopp Kit assumes I have my [EDC (Every Day Cary)](https://mikehathaway.com/2023/09/08/cruise-day-bag.html) bag stocked and packed.  So there are items you may keep in your kit that I leave out of mine, if you are using this guide be sure to look at the EDC web page to make sure you fill in all the gaps.
