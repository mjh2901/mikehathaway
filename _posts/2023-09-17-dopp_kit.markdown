What should be in your overnight kit?

Yes, another travel and packing post.  Much like using packing cubes, I look at everything as a set kit that can contain smaller kits.  They all work together.  My overnight kit assumes I have my [EDC (Every Day Cary)](https://mikehathaway.com/2023/09/08/cruise-day-bag.html) bag stocked and packed.  So there are items you may keep in your kit that I leave out of mine, if you are using this guide be sure to look at the EDC web page to make sure you fill in all the gaps.
