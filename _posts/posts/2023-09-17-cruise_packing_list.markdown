This is my cruise packing list

I have a developed a love hate relationship with packing checklists.  Most lists are just that a list, a few are broken down in sections.  I tend to pack things in kits, it could be an ovenight kit, or a packing cube that contains everthing for swiming.  By splitting everything into kits and cubes you can concentrate on one section at a time.  Its also makes it easier as I have an overnight kit ready to go at all times, and my every day cary bag is also at the ready so I just throw those into the suitcase and there is a massive part of the list gone.  So here is my cruise packing list and unlike a lot of lists out there it is specific to guys.  Women this list kinda works I am sure its easy to come with additions to make it perfect. 

For those that want a simple checklist, I have that here
