**My Travel First Aid Kit**

Better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.  I was actually a First Aid and Advanced First Aid instructor and after teachinga ll those courses, we never gave people a first aid kit list.  This list is based on the [Johns Hopkins Traveler's First-Aid Kit](https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/wellness-and-prevention/travelers-firstaid-kit) and some additions that I have used or purchased while on trips.  You can fit all these items in a large zip-lock bag.  I have added a section at the bottom for Specific Travel/Car/Scouting.  These are items I do not pack in a suitcase but I do keep in my car/road trip first aid kit.  I added this section because there are items that I disagree with the Johns Hopkins list as far as what I would have in my luggage on a trip I am flying off to yet I would not absolutely not go on a road trip or backpacking without.  

**Medications**

* \[ \]Dramamine

* \[ \]Pain Reliever (I carry Aleve and Advil or Naproxin and Ibuprofen)

* \[ \]Pseudoephedrine (cruises bring you in contact with plants you never knew you were allergic to)

* \[ \]Pepto Bismol Chews (The jellybean form of Pepto, is completely brilliant).

* \[ \] AlcaSeltzer (or other ant acid)

* \[ \] Imodium (or other antidiarrhea)

I keep pills in a little [aluminum screw top container](https://www.amazon.com/Hulless-Aluminum-Refillable-Containers-Container/dp/B072MC3K86/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3JUWN1483R5KW&keywords=small\+aluminum\+tins\+with\+screw\+lids&qid=1694406204&sprefix=small\+aluminum\+tins\+with\+screw\+lids%2Caps%2C152&sr=8-2) to save space.

**External First Ai**

* \[ \]Triple antibiotic ointment

* \[ \]Hydrocortisone Cream

* \[ \]Band-Aids

* \[ \] Gauze pads 2 - inch and 4-inch

* \[ \] Elastic wraps to wrap wrist, ankle, knee and elbow injuries (ACE Bandage)

* \[ \] Butterfly Bandages

* \[ \]Sterile gauze pads

* \[ \]Alcohol prep pads

* \[ \]Tweezers (This is a must, not having them can ruin an entire day.)

* \[ \]Disposable exam gloves

**Miscellaneous**

* \[ \] Bug Bite Thing

* \[ \] CPR Face Shield

* \[ \] Thermometer (electric no old school glass, even in a carry case)

* \[ \] Hand Sanitizer or Antibacterial hand wipe

**Specific Travel / Car Kit / Scouting**\
  These are items I would not pack in luggage for trip, but would pack in a car first aid kit for when you are a distance from civilization.  

* \[ \] Triangular bandage to wrap injuries and make an arm sling

* Safety pins to fasten splints and bandages

* \[ \] Guaze in rolls

* \[ \] CPR Pocket Mask 

* \[ \] Narcan (Naloxone) Everyone should have cheap access to this, it is cheaper if you have insurance so research your options.  

* Adhesive tape to keep gauze in place

* Scissors with rounded tips to cut tape, gauze, or clothes, if necessary (Note that this may not be allowed in your carry-on bag if traveling by air.)

* Hydrogen Peroxide (get a dark travel spray bottle)

* Cold Pack
