**My Travel First Aid Kit**

Better to have it and not need it than to need it and not have it.  You can fit all these items in a zip-lock sandwich bag.  I keep pills in a little [alumunum screw top container](https://www.amazon.com/Hulless-Aluminum-Refillable-Containers-Container/dp/B072MC3K86/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3JUWN1483R5KW&keywords=small\+aluminum\+tins\+with\+screw\+lids&qid=1694406204&sprefix=small\+aluminum\+tins\+with\+screw\+lids%2Caps%2C152&sr=8-2)

**Medications**

* \[ \]Dramamine

* \[ \]Pain Reliever (I carry Aleve and Advil or Naproxin and Ibuprofin)

* \[ \]Pseudoephedrine (cruises bring you in contact with plants you never knew you were allergic to)

* \[ \]Pepto Bismol Chews (The jellybean form of Pepto, is completely brilliant).

* \[ \] AlcaSeltzer

* 

**External First Aid**

* \[ \]Triple antibiotic ointment

* \[ \]Band-Aids

* \[ \]Sterile gauze pads

* \[ \]Alcohol prep pads

* \[ \]Tweezers (This is a must, not having them can ruin an entire day.)

* \[ \]Disposable exam gloves

**Miscellaneous**

* \[ \] Bug Bite Thing
