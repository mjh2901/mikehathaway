   Bug-out bags are constantly discussed on the Internet and YouTube. Fema recommends being ready to survive for three days without modern infrastructure in case of a natural disaster. The zombie Acropolis bag is the other side of bug-out bags, which usually includes a firearm.  

   A tech podcaster (Patric Norton) did his urban bug-out bag years ago. The video is long gone, but it was a much more realistic take.  Instead of a bug-out bag, his was a get-home bag.  The claim was that his family bug-out bag was more about throwing food, family, and camping gear in an older (IE, no computer) vehicle and driving away from the Bay Area.  But to get to that point, he needed to be able to hike from San Francisco to the East Bay.  My bug-out bag is a take on this idea; I need to get from Sunnyvale to Dublin 40 miles.  Or drive away to a known meeting location that my family will also head toward, which is a full state away.

**Where is my bag ?**
   In my daily commute, Vehicle

**What is not in my bag?**
   Two items are discussed in almost every bug-out bag video.  First a firearm, My car is parked in a school parking lots in the state of California, a secured firearm in my vehicle is a felony, and if someone found out instant termination.  While no case law on felony involves a school employee, there have been terminations even in union environments.  
  Second, two to five thousand dollars in cash.  If you are bugging out even in a car for some disaster, it is safe to assume electronic money access may be down.  You need enough paper money to purchase gas and or food if you are traveling to safety.  I am not keeping that in my car in a school parking lot or any Parking lot in the state of California.

What is my bug-out bag?
   My bag is an old, comfortable backpack in a Pelican Air 615 case in the back of my car.
