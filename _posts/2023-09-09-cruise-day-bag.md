### The Ultimate Excursion / Day trip bag!

Whats in your bag when you step off the ship?

I have been cruising for a while, but before that I have been a season pass holder for Disneyland Park.  My family refers to my day trips in the park and sometimes off the ship as a "Death March". Over the years and many death marches have I developed a day bag that is both ready for anything while not carying anything that can cause problems.  If you are getting off the ship or just planning to spend the day in a lounge chair a well supplied day bag can make your time on the run, or on the lounge chair without need.

My bag setup has several staples and then items I change out depending on the day.  For instance if I am walking off the ship I do not carry headphones.  If I am spending the day on ship on deck I do bring headphones.  Every bag packing video and list I have seen on the net has a couple major problems.  They try to pack everything you will need for every possibility or they focus on the beach and nothing else.  You will find this guide split up into sections, you could pack each section in a zip loc and swap out the ziploc "kits" based on your day plans.

My starting point is the bag.  For every person there is the perfect bag, and what I lok is not what you like.  So here are the basics.  I am sticking with someting smaller than a backpack and larger than a purse.  This bag is not intending to cary your clothing or a towel.  If you need a towel or change of clothes use a second bag just for that stuff.  I find if the bag is two large it gets left because its to much of a hassle, and if it is to small its stuffed and hard to find items in or you wind up leaving things behind and regret them later.

My bag is a Tactical Sling Bag, very military. I have given one to my my Brother in law and each of his boys for day tripping.  I have seen this bag described on amazon as "Dads Diaper Bag" or the perfect every day gun bag.  My wife laughs at it because where the gun goes is padded and perfect for my ipad.  Whats important is its smaller than a full backup yet able to cary everything I need.  This is also my under the seat cary on for flights.

Whats in the bag

## Hydration

I carry a 26 oz Yeti Rambler with the straw cap.  Its a little larger than a normal water bottle but once filled with ice stays cold all day.  I like to fill mine completely with ice in the morning then add water right before stepping off the ship.  I attach the bottle with a [Molle bottle holder](https://www.amazon.com/WICKTICK-Adjustable-Tactical-Outdoor-Backpack/dp/B0C4KM31CZ/ref=sr_1_54?crid=2MXY3HGIXG51Z&keywords=tactical%2Bbottle%2Bholder&qid=1694402561&sprefix=tactical%2Bbottle%2Bholder%2Caps%2C186&sr=8-54&th=1)
I use a my water bottle on ship filling it with Ice tea or water.

If you want to go cheap you can [silicon bottle holders](https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Carrier-Keychain-Outdoor-Activities/dp/B07W1NQQKD/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1FKWXAQHRSLH&keywords=rubber+lanyard+bottle+holder&qid=1694402641&sprefix=rubber+lanyard+bottle+hold%2Caps%2C157&sr=8-3) that attach to your bag and hold any water bottle.

## Technology
- Phone
- External Battery Charging Pack (Phones do not last on trips, running the camera drains the battery at a high rate.  Phones with a battery that is OK for the day seem to run out before the excursion ends.  
- Phone charging cable
- Headphones (When on ship, I leave them in the cabin when on an excursion)

## Wallet
- ID (Drivers License or Passport card)
- SeaPass required to get back on the ship
- Excursion credit card (I use one credit card for on ship charges and bring a different card just for excursions.  This way if a sketchy restaraunt steals my card I still have a working credit card to get home with.  Never carry an ATM card or those combo visa/check cards off the ship)
- Cash for tips and vendors.  Most ports have local curency and just about everyone works in dollars.

## Snacking
When on ship you need nothing, but its nice to have somthing just in case on those all day excursions.  Especially if you are like me and rather explore than hit a restaraunt.  Bring as much as you want or nothing.  Some of these items are for when I am on a day trip and not on a cruise excursion.

- Water flavor packets (you can get squirt bottles and packets that turn a bottle of water into the drink of your choice)
- Beef Jerky Stick
- Nut Pack
- Granola Bar
- Whine bottle opener 
- Mini Hot Sauce
- Mini Montreal Steak Seasing (seasoning packer of your choice)
- Sweatener Packets many locations just have sugar.


## First Aid
Better to have it and not need than to need it and not have it.  You can fit all these items in a zip loc sandwich bag.

I keep pills in a little [alumunum screw top container](https://www.amazon.com/Hulless-Aluminum-Refillable-Containers-Container/dp/B072MC3K86/ref=sr_1_2?crid=3JUWN1483R5KW&keywords=small+aluminum+tins+with+screw+lids&qid=1694406204&sprefix=small+aluminum+tins+with+screw+lids%2Caps%2C152&sr=8-2)
- Dramamine 
- Pain Releaver (I cary a Aleve and Advil or Naproxin and Ibuprofin)
- Pseudoephedrine (cruies bing you in contact with plants you never new you where alergic to)
- Pepto Bismol Chews (The jellybean form of pepto, its completely brilliant)
- Talcom Powder (lots of walking a little bit to releave chafing really helps)
- Tripple antibiotic ointment
- Band Aids
- Sterile gauze pads
- Disposable exam gloves

## Personal Hygene
- Comb
- Chapstick
- Tissues
- [Compressed Towels](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0741519LR/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&th=1) (these things are awsome, get a bunch carry a few)

## Other
- Caribeaners
- Hat
- Sunglasses


## What not to pack
This is a new section specific for cruises... and Disneyland.  There are items I cary at all times that I make sure I remove before traveling.  Double check for stuff like this, you dont want to dump something that has meaning to you at a security check point.

- Pocket Knife (this is why I cary a seperate bottle opener)
- Screw Driver
- Multi Tools
- Anything with a blade or could be considered a weapon
- Tools
