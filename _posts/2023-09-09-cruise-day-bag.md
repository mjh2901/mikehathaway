### The Ultimate Excursion / Day trip bag!

Whats in your bag when you step off the ship?

I have been cruising for a while, but before that I have been a season pass holder for Disneyland Park.  My family refers to my day trips in the park and sometimes off the ship as a "Death March". Over the years and many death marches have I developed a day bag that is both ready for anything while not carying anything that can cause problems.  If you are getting off the ship or just planning to spend the day in a lounge chair a well supplied day bag can make your time on the run, or on the lounge chair without need.

My bag setup has several staples and then items I change out depending on the day.  For instance if I am walking off the ship I do not carry headphones.  If I am spending the day on ship on deck I do bring headphones.  Every bag packing video and list I have seen on the net has a couple major problems.  They try to pack everything you will need for every possibility or they focus on the beach and nothing else.  You will find this guide split up into sections, you could pack each section in a zip loc and swap out the ziploc "kits" based on your day plans.

My starting point is the bag.  For every person there is the perfect bag, and what I lok is not what you like.  So here are the basics.  I am sticking with someting smaller than a backpack and larger than a purse.  This bag is not intending to cary your clothing or a towel.  If you need a towel or change of clothes use a second bag just for that stuff.  I find if the bag is two large it gets left because its to much of a hassle, and if it is to small its stuffed and hard to find items in or you wind up leaving things behind and regret them later.

My bag is a Tactical Sling Bag, very military. I have given one to my my Brother in law and each of his boys for day tripping.  I have seen this bag described on amazon as "Dads Diaper Bag" or the perfect every day gun bag.  My wife laughs at it because where the gun goes is padded and perfect for my ipad.  Whats important is its smaller than a full backup yet able to cary everything I need.  This is also my under the seat cary on for flights.

Whats in the bag

Hydration
I carry a 26 oz Yeti Rambler with the straw cap.  Its a little larger than a normal water bottle but once filled with ice stays cold all day.  I like to fill mine completely with ice in the morning then add water right before stepping off the ship.  I attach the bottle with a [Mole bottle holder](https://www.amazon.com/WICKTICK-Adjustable-Tactical-Outdoor-Backpack/dp/B0C4KM31CZ/ref=sr_1_54?crid=2MXY3HGIXG51Z&keywords=tactical%2Bbottle%2Bholder&qid=1694402561&sprefix=tactical%2Bbottle%2Bholder%2Caps%2C186&sr=8-54&th=1)
I use a my water bottle on ship filling it with Ice tea or water.

If you want to go cheap you can [silicon bottle holders](https://www.amazon.com/Silicone-Carrier-Keychain-Outdoor-Activities/dp/B07W1NQQKD/ref=sr_1_3?crid=1FKWXAQHRSLH&keywords=rubber+lanyard+bottle+holder&qid=1694402641&sprefix=rubber+lanyard+bottle+hold%2Caps%2C157&sr=8-3) that attach to your bag and hold any water bottle.
